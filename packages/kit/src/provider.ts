/**
 * Author a provider constructor — the published artifact of an integration
 * (`@crestable/auth0`, …) and the same entry point homegrown providers use.
 *
 * The implementation is the internal mechanism, written at the root
 * {@link Contract}: vendor terms only — `Options` and `Payload` are the
 * author's own, and the app's contract is reached solely through the
 * bridge. The returned constructor is the typed front door: the app calls
 * it once, and the schema argument pins `C` — its `base` carries the
 * contract in a plainly inferable slot — so the bridge is contextually
 * typed against the app's own vocabulary with no annotation anywhere.
