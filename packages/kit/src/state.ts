/**
 * Builds a guarded {@link State}: a deep proxy over the container that
 * proves every write against the schema before committing it — a top-level
 * `current` assignment, a nested member write (`state.current.email = …`),
 * an array mutation (`state.current.scopes.push(…)`), or a deletion.
 *
 * Mutations are proven on a draft — a clone of the current user with the
 * write applied — so a rejected write throws a {@link SchemaError} and
 * leaves the underlying container untouched. Reads pass through, with
 * nested objects wrapped on the way out so the guard travels with them.
 * The container stays the source of truth: writes land on it in place, so
 * a caller-owned (e.g. reactive) object sees every mutation.
 *
 * @param schema - The validation bundle writes are proven against.
 * @param target - The underlying container; created when omitted.
 * @param observe - Called after every committed write — a top-level
 *   assignment, a deep mutation, or a deletion. A rejected write never
 *   reaches it.
 * @returns The same-shaped state, guarded.
