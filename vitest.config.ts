 * Whole-repo entry point: each package carries its own vitest.config.ts, and

 * aggregated coverage) still covers everything. Day-to-day runs go through
 * `pnpm test`, which fans out to the packages in parallel.
 *
 * The projects list is enumerated rather than globbed because vitest errors
 * on a glob that matches nothing, and the workspace starts empty.
